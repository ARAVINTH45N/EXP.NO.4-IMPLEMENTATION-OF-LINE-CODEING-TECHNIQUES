# EXP.NO.4 â€“ Implementation of Line Coding Techniques


##  AIM
The objective of this experiment is to study the **Line Coding techniques** using the **trainer kit**.

---

##  APPARATUS REQUIRED
- Trainer Kit (DCL-05 and DCL-06)
- DSO (10MHz)
- Patch Cords
- Power Supply (0-30V)

---

##  PROCEDURE

1. Connect power supply in proper polarity to the kits **DCL-05 and DCL-06** and switch it on.  
2. Connect **CLOCK** and **DATA** generated on DCL-05 to **CODING CLOCK IN** and **DATA INPUT** respectively by means of the patch chords provided.  
3. Connect the coded data **NRZ-L** on DCL-05 to the corresponding **DATA INPUT NRZ-L** of the decoding logic on DCL-06.  
4. Keep the switch **SW2 for NRZ-L** in ON position for decoding logic as shown in the block diagram.  
5. Observe the **coded and decoded signal** on the oscilloscope.  
6. Connect the coded data **NRZ-M** on DCL-05 to the corresponding **DATA INPUT NRZ-M** of the decoding logic on DCL-06.  
7. Keep the switch **SW2 for NRZ-M** in ON position for decoding logic.  
8. Observe the **coded and decoded signal** on the oscilloscope.  
9. Connect the coded data **NRZ-S** on DCL-05 to the corresponding **DATA INPUT NRZ-S** of the decoding logic on DCL-06.  
10. Keep the switch **SW2 for NRZ-S** in ON position for decoding logic.  
11. Observe the **coded and decoded signal** on the oscilloscope.  
12. Use the **RESET** switch for clear data observation if necessary.

##  Unipolar to Bipolar / Bipolar to Unipolar

- a. Connect **NRZ-L** signal from DCL-05 to the input post `IN` of **Unipolar to Bipolar** and observe the **Bipolar output** at the post `OUT`.  
- b. Then connect **Bipolar output** signal to the input post `IN` of **Bipolar to Unipolar** and observe **Unipolar out** at post `OUT`.

## RESULT
Thus, the **Line Coding Techniques** were successfully analyzed and observed using the trainer kit and the **graphs were plotted** using the DSO.
